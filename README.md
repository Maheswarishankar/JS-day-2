1.Write a blog on the difference between document & Window objects???

***Document***

* It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser. 
* It is loaded inside the window. *It is the object of window property.
* We can access the document from a window using the window. document
* The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model) *All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
* Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window.

***Window***

* represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage 
• It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser. 
• It is the object of the browser. • We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.
• The window is part of BOM, not DOM. • Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
• Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
